# This is a Java Swing application for the operations of a fictional taxi service. The application handles the following entities:
# The taxi service contains the following information: TIN (Tax Identification Number), name, address, starting fare, and price per kilometer. The taxi service system maintains records of three types of users: customers, drivers, and dispatchers. All users are required to provide the following information: username, password, first name, last name, ID number, address, gender, and phone number. Dispatchers are employees working in the call center. In addition to the common user data, dispatchers also provide information about their salary, telephone line number, and the department they work in. The service has two phone departments: the ride request department and the complaints department. For drivers, the following additional information is recorded: salary, association membership card number, and the car (each driver has one vehicle at a time). Vehicles are a separate entity in the system, and the following information is recorded for each vehicle: model, manufacturer, year of manufacture, license plate number, taxi vehicle number (a unique identifier for each vehicle within the taxi service), and vehicle type (the taxi service has passenger cars and van vehicles). The core entity in the taxi service's operation is the ride. The following data is recorded for each ride: date and time of the order, departure address, destination address, the customer who placed the order, the driver who accepted the order, the number of kilometers driven, the duration of the ride, and the ride status. The ride status can be CREATED, CREATED-WAITING, ASSIGNED, ACCEPTED, COMPLETED, or REJECTED. Rides can be ordered by phone call - when this ride is created, its initial status is CREATED. After the dispatcher assigns the ride to a specific driver, its status changes to ASSIGNED.
# Functionalities
# - sign-in to the system - unauthenticated users can sign in to the system by entering their username and registered user password. Afterward, the user is logged in and can perform activities assigned to their role. System login is implemented for all user types, with each having access to specific system functionalities. Note: all users are loaded from a text file; there is no registration for any user type.
# Dispatcher functionalities - dispatchers have access to all entities and all actions on them (they are considered system administrators): </br> - display and modification of taxi service data. </br> display, addition, modification and deletion of all drivers (when adding a driver, it is possible to assign one of the available cars, if any exist). </br> - display, addition, modification, and deletion of all cars (when adding a car, it is possible to assign it to a driver who does not have an assigned car; deletion is possible only for cars that are not assigned to any driver). </br> - display all rides created via phone calls. </br> - assignment of rides created via phone calls to drivers (at this step, the dispatcher assigns a driver and changes the ride status from CREATED-WAITING to ASSIGNED). </br> - combined search of all drivers by name, last name, salary, and car. </br> - combined search of all cars by model, manufacturer, year of manufacture, license plate number, and taxi vehicle number. </br> - display of a summarized report on a daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly basis. The report should contain data on the total number of rides, the number of rides ordered through the application, the number of rides ordered by phone call, the number of active drivers, the average ride duration, the average number of kilometers driven, the total earnings for all rides, and the average earnings per ride. Driver earnings per ride should be calculated using the following formula: starting fare + number of kilometers driven * price per kilometer.
# Driver Functionalities </br> - display of assigned rides (rides created via phone calls that the dispatcher has assigned to a driver). The driver has the option to accept or decline the ride. By accepting the ride, the ride status changes from ASSIGNED to ACCEPTED, while by declining the ride, the ride status changes from ASSIGNED to REJECTED. </br> - for all accepted rides, it is necessary to ensure that the ride can be completed, which involves changing the ride status from ACCEPTED to COMPLETED, entering the number of kilometers traveled during the ride, and specifying the ride duration. </br> - drivers can participate in an auction for a new ride. Drivers input how many minutes it will take them to reach the given address. An algorithm is designed that assigns rides to drivers. The allocation of rides is influenced by the estimated arrival time, driver ratings, driver earnings within a specific interval, vehicle age (customers may request newer vehicles), pet-friendliness, etc. There is a simulation of multiple driver bids and ride assignments. It maintains a history of auctions. To earn more points, expand the information about vehicles or drivers. Additionally, enable customers to rate drivers after the ride (rating from 1 to 5).
# Customer functionalities </br> - ordering a ride via phone.
# Additional notes </br> - it is provided appropriate navigation within the application. </br> - all entities have an identifier of type int or long. </br> - data are stored sorted by the key. </br> - searching by the identifier is implemented using binary search. </br> - sorting is enabled for all tabular views in the application. </br> - data for all entities are stored in text files. For the specified files, methods are implemented for reading and writing data. For data that have a predefined set of possible values (e.g., user gender, car type, ride status, phone department type, etc.), appropriate enumerations are implemented. </br> - when deleting, all entities are logically deleted, which means that data about them remain in the files but deleted entities (nor their related entities) aren't visible in the system, except in situations where it doesn't make sense. (example: deleting a driver does not necessarily involve deleting a car.) </br> - all data, except those specified as potentially undefined, are mandatory. Therefore, when entering or modifying entities, checks are implemented that will prevent the action if all mandatory data have not been entered.
